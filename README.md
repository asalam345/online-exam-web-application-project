# Online Exam Web Project with .NET Core

The purpose of this project was to create an online examination system. There are three user roles in the project, which are student, teacher and admin. A user with teacher role can create a course, and after creating a course she can create exams related to the course she created and add questions to the exams.

Each question will have number of choices ranging from two to five and users will assign points for each question they created.

For a user with student role to enter the exams of a course, she first must send an enrollment request for the course, after enrollment request is approved she can enter the exams.
An admin user can see other user profiles and lock their accounts and also she can see the courses created and delete them.

In this project, I used bootstrap to ease the development process, used ajax as often as possible to provide better user experience and used entity framework for creating models and accessing database.
